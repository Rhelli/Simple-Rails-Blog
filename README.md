# 📖 A Simple Blog Web App - Ruby on Rails

This project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ 'The Global School for Remote Software Developers!').

This is another quick, short project, with the purpose of practicing some rudimentary RoR knowledge in the attempt to implement a very basic Rails based web blog. It sure ain't pretty, but it works!

Included in the scope of this blog is:
 - An index page - Listing all articles/blog posts
 - A 'show' page that displays the selected article
 - Article titles and body (of course)
 - Comments and Commenter names
 - Basic http security protocols protecting the deletion of comments and page access (all bar the 'index' and 'show' page)

 Included functionality:
 - Create new articles
 - Edit articles
 - Delete articles
 - Create comments
 - Delete comments

The authentication details, if prompted are as follows:
 - User: 'admin'
 - Password: 'admin'
